For each condition, participants were instructed to stand as still as possible for 55 seconds, keeping their gaze fixated on a specific point, feet together and arms held at their side. Participants were recorded using three different systems, detailed below. Tracking Patient Motion NIH BalancePod App An iPhone was worn around the participants' waists. The iPhone was connected via Bluetooth to an iPad running the NIH Toolbox app, which was used to administer the Standing Balance Test. Qualisys Retroreflective markers were placed on the participant, and a Qualisys marker-based system was used to capture motion capture data FreeMoCap Six webcams were set up around the subject. Cameras were calibrated, and then used to record the patient during the SBT. Data Analysis Reconstructing 3D Data Synchronized videos from the webcams were fed through the FreeMoCap software to reconstruct 3D joint centers. FreeMoCap data was smoothed using a low-pass, 4th order, 6Hz Butterworth filter. Qualisys data was downsampled and time-synchronized with FreeMoCap data. Specific frames were annotated for the start and end point of each balance condition within the recording. 1600 frames were analyzed for each condition. Center of Mass Calculation For both systems, segment and total body center of mass was calculated using anthropometric data. For each condition, the overall path length of the center of mass was calculated. Center of mass position was also used to calculate center of mass velocity as well during each condition.","title":"Methods"},{"location":"methods/#methods","text":"","title":"Methods"},{"location":"methods/#task-the-nih-standing-balance-test-sbt","text":"Participants were asked to complete three trials of the NIH SBT.

However, these tests tend to be subjective and may not be responsive to small changes in a patient. The ability to capture human movement data while performing these clinical assessments could provide clinicians with quantitative, standardized insight into patient movement capability. FreeMoCap is an open-source, low-cost, markerless motion capture system that leverages advancements in computer vision and machine learning to capture human movement data without specialized equipment. To validate the suitability of FreeMoCap as a clinical assessment tool, we record participants performing the NIH Standing Balance Test (SBT). We then compare center of mass (COM) derived parameters based on 3D pose estimation from FreeMoCap to both 3D estimates from Qualisys, a marker-based system, and to the outcomes reported by the NIH BalancePod app. Existing Technology and Limitations Systems such as marker-based motion capture and force plates can provide highly accurate data, but they are extremely expensive and require specialized equipment, which often restricts their use to the laboratory environment. On the other hand, accelerometers are affordable and can be used to track real-world activities, but are limited in the information that they can provide about body position and orientation. As such, there is a need for a low-cost, accessible tool that could augment current rehabilitation practices by providing a comprehensive human movement data of a patient The FreeMotionCapture Project (FreeMoCap) FreeMoCap is an open-source, free, markerless motion capture system that leverages advancements in computer vision and machine learning to capture human movement data without specialized equipment. insert all things about freemocap here Aim Validate the Free Motion Capture Project (FreeMoCap), on a clinical balance assessment: the NIH Standing Balance Test (SBT) The NIH Standing Balance Test (SBT) The NIH SBT is an assessment tool designed to evaluate an individual\u2019s postural stability and balance.
